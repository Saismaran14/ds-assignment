## Arithmetic Expressions
Arithmetic expressions are used to perform mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# Multiplying and adding numbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = a * b + 2
result
# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
## Objectives
- Learn about different data science languages.
- Understand commonly used data science libraries.
- Get familiar with basic arithmetic operations in Python.
